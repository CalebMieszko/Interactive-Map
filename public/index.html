1. Goals

How will you connect your files?
How will you test that the files are connected properly and loading as expected?
What events will your application need?
- What is the user going to need to do?
- How should the application respond to that?
What APIs will you need and in what order?
- Leaflet
- Foursquare
    - How do I know which order they should be used in?
    - Which order do they get called in the typical user workflow... what will the user be doing, and how will that interact with each API?
    - What API do I connect to in order to prompt the user for their location?
How will you obtain the user's location?
    - Good question! I should research this.
How will you add the user's location to the map?
    - Answering the question above should get me on the right track, but I can do another search if I need to find more.
How will you get the selected location from the user?
    - The drop-down list I created will allow them to choose any kind of place to look for. But... how do I get this as data? A submit button?
    YES! A submit button will do the trick. I'll only need one, since the dropdown will interface with it directly.
How will you add that information to the map?
    - I'll have to interface with an API, and I know Foursquare does things like this. I should check out the documentation, and turn the steps into psuedocode.
